<div class="text-column">
  <h1>Contact Page</h1>

  <p>Here is contact page, you can add forms here.</p>

  <p>
    The page you're looking at is purely static HTML, with no client-side interactivity needed.
    Because of that, we don't need to load any JavaScript. Try viewing the page's source, or opening
    the devtools network panel and reloading.
