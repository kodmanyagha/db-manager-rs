# Database Manager

There are lots of database manager app around there but some of them are eats too much memory,
some has high price, some can connect to only one database etc...
I created a desktop app which doesn't have these kind of lacks.

### Tech Stack

In first, I <3 Rust. Rust is best language I have ever seen. I think if Rust invented
before C/C++, no one would use C, Linux kernel would have been developed with Rust.
I used Rust, Typescript, Tauri and Sveltekit in this project.
